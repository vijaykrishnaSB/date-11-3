        <h1>My Bangalore</h1>
        <p>
          Bangalore is home to various prestigious institutes, colleges and
          universities. In addition to this, it is also the hub of many software
          and aerospace industries. As the city offers many benefits, the
          population of the city is growing day by day. Most importantly, the
          city is very clean and elegant despite the increasing
          industrialization. This city was renamed Bengaluru in 2014. If we
          consider the southern part of India, Bangalore stands to be the
          busiest city. It is the industrial city of Karnataka because it is
          home to several IT organizations. Nonetheless, the major attraction of
          the city has to be the parks and gardens. Thus, it is also known as
          the garden city.
